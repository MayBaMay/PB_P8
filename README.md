# PUR BEURRE - OPENCLASSROOM PYTHON - PROJECT #8
This open source project was created for the OpenClassRoom's Python developer course (Project 8/13)).
It is a DJANGO application integrating a back-end part based on Python 3.7 and a front-end part developed with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript using Bootsrap.

Ask the application a product name, select one of the products to confirm your choice and it will give you a list of similar products with a better nutriscore.
When registered, the user can save those favorite subsitutes.

## How to install this project

### 1 - Fork the project
### 2 - Clone the project on your PC
### 3 - Create and set the database
This project was conceived with postgresql, but we can use an other db engine.

#### STEP 1 : Create a database.
(with postgresql)<br/>
`createdb <your database name>`

#### STEP 2: Create your virtualenv in this path: Projet OpenClassRoom/Projet-8-Pur-Beurre
(on mac and linux)<br/>
`cd PB_P8`<br/>
`virtualenv env -p python3`<br/>
`source env/bin/activate`<br/>
`pip install -r requirements.txt`<br/>

#### STEP 3 : Setting up the database in pur_beurre_project/settings.py
```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': '<your database name>',
        'USER': '<your username>',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': '',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```

#### STEP 4 : Migrate the model into the database
`./manage.py migrate`

#### STEP 5 : Load database

### *Option 1 : fastest one, with a dump file(.json) and the django loaddata command*

`./manage.py loaddata foodSearch/dumps/foodSearch.json`

### *Option 2 : slowest one, with the script that imports datas from the OpenFoodFacts API*

1. We uses the [OpenFoodFacts API for python](https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-python)<br/>
Make sure you've installed it on your environnement (not in the requirements.txt)<br/>
`sudo pip install git+https://github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-python`<br/>

2. Open the module **pur_beurre_project/foodSearch/management/commands/settings.py**.<br/>
Change the pages from OpenFoodFacts you want to include in your database<br/>
*NB: 10 products per page (around 5 seconds per page on my mac)*
```
FIRST_PAGE =  <first page from openfoodfacts api you want to load>
LAST_PAGE = <last page from openfoodfacts api you want to load>
DB_REPORTS_FILE = <file in which you want a report of your DB changes> (optional)
```
3. Launch the command on your terminal<br/>
`./manage.py fill_db -f`


#### STEP 6 : Launch project
`./manage.py runserver`
With your usual browser, use the application on url http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## Next Steps
This app tries to correspond to the specifications. Some features, specified as not required, have not been developped:
* For now, user can't change his password or ask for an other one if he lost it
* This app only compares products with nutriscore, it would be relevant to add criterias as organic, components...
* The user profile is as specified almost empty, we could add more informations on the user
* We could add a research input in the favorite page.
